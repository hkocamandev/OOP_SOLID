SRP stands for Single Responsibility Principle in SOLID Principles.
Every class or module has to have one reason to change or it should serve only for one general purpose.
In this module: UserController class was responsible for both validating users and storing users at first.
We changed it and separated the roles of validations and storing into other classes (UserValidator and UserPersistenceService).
We sent user information into these newly created classes, thus each of them being responsible of their own goals.
